# FinForce (5845)

## Motivation
One of the primary challenges with existing personal budgeting applications is
**their reliance on manual input of data**, which can lead to inaccuracies and
inconsistencies due to human error. People often forget to log their expenses or
may enter incorrect information, resulting in an inaccurate representation of their
financial situation. We believe that in this generation of rising automata, manually
logging every single one of our spending is considered tedious and redundant,
and there are better solutions to counter this problem.

Another challenge faced by students and young professionals is the
**fragmentation of financial management tools**. As stock investing is being
taught more frequently in universities, and students are taking an increasing
interest in it, especially when most people can just access trading platforms just
with their phones. However, individuals often need to rely on multiple apps to
manage different aspects of their finances, such as budgeting, expense tracking,
and stock investing. This fragmentation can result in a disjointed experience and
may discourage users from effectively managing their finances. We believe that
all of these functionalities could be converged into a single place instead of all over
the place and having to keep track with app is for what.

## Aim
**Our goal for our Orbital project is to develop a unified app for personal
finance management and stock tracking**. Personal finance tracking is an
essential component of the app, as it enables users to monitor their expenses, set
budgets, and work towards their financial goals. **Integration with open banking
APIs** will allow for real-time tracking of account balances and transactions,
ensuring accurate and up-to-date information.

In addition to personal finance management, the app will offer **stock tracking
features**, such as customizable watchlists and portfolio performance monitoring.
Notifications will keep users informed about significant market events and updates,
helping them make timely and well-informed investment decisions.

As an extension, **gamification elements** will be incorporated to encourage good
financial habits and user engagement. By setting personal and group challenges,
users can motivate themselves and others to stay on track with their financial
goals and compete in a friendly, collaborative environment.

In future, the app could include advanced features, such as **communities and
forums** where users can share tips and insights on personal wealth management
and investment ideas. These interactive spaces will facilitate knowledge sharing
and foster a supportive network for users to learn from one another.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
